Rover - School C&P Project

This is my school project on Chemistry and Physics, which although not complex, was quite interesting.

Installation Instructions:

    Open or download the main.py file.
    Manually retype or transfer the file to a calculator via the Texas Instruments website (link here). IMPORTANT! The calculator must support Python.
    Launch via Menu -> Execute -> Execute.

Program Instructions:
Upon launch, you will enter a "menu." Choose a number from 1 to 4, where:
1 - Labyrinth
2 - Shapes
3 - Avoider
4 - Drift.

Let's go through each:

LABYRINTH
Insert commands from the list:

    f - forward
    r - right
    l - left
    b - backwards

Commands can be entered together or individually.
For example: fffrlb or each command separately like "f...f..." etc.
After entering one or all commands, press Enter.
The robot will start moving immediately!

SHAPES
Initially, enter the first letters of one of the 3 shapes.
For a square, enter its height followed by its width.
For a triangle, simply enter the length of one side.
For a circle... try it yourself ðŸ˜‰

AVOIDER
Simply run the program. To start the robot's movement, place your hand in front of the sensors, about 10-15 cm away from the front sensors.
Pressing 7 will stop the robot's movement and exit the program. On some calculators, this may not work; use the standard program interruption by holding down ESC.

DRIFT
Just run it! Exit the program by holding down ESC.

OTHER
From any program except Avoider and Drift, you can return to the menu by entering "back."
To terminate the program, hold down ESC or enter exit.
